	<h3>CDI issues in EAR</h3>
	<p>
		Note that CDI has known issues when the same web fragment library is bundled in multiple WARs in a single EAR and the CDI feature is based on an <code>Extension</code>.
		It's important to understand that those issues are not related to OmniFaces, but to the CDI spec.
		For an overview of those issues, please refer <a href="https://github.com/omnifaces/omnifaces/wiki/Known-Issues-(CDI)">Known issues of OmniFaces CDI features in combination with specific application servers</a>.
		Needless to say is that EAR is a dead end since introduction of the cloud and has no value in the microservices world.
		In other words, if you want to use CDI (or microservices), then you shouldn't be using an EAR in first place.
