	<h3>CDI issues in EAR</h3>
	<p>
		Note that CDI has known issues when OmniFaces is bundled in multiple WARs in a single EAR and the CDI feature is based on an <code>Extension</code>.
		It's important to understand that those issues are not related to OmniFaces, but to the broken CDI spec.
		For an overview of those issues, please refer
