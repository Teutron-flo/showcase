		This is only needed for the "Passing listener method with zero arguments" test, and is
        only needed for implementations of Mojarra before 2.1.8. (see https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/mojarra/issues/2351)
		
		The problem is that Mojarra 2.1.7 and before copy a method expression based on the literal EL expression only, which
		means the variable mapper isn't copied. As it's the variable mapper that contain the reference
		to our method, this copied expression can't be resolved.
		
		A workaround is to put the method into request scope with nested visibility via the ui:repeat trick.
